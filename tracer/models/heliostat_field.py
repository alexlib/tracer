"""
Manage a field of flat-surface heliostats aimed at a solar tower. The tower
is assumed to be at the origin, and the aiming is done by giving the sun's
azimuth and elevation.

The local coordinates system assumes that +x is north and +z is up, which is
also known as the Local Coordinates System in solar energy.
